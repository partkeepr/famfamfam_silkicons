This is a copy of the famous silk icons, created by Mark James, Birmingham, UK. It is intented to be used as git submodule.

Why?
---

There are plenty of projects using the silk icon set. Most developers simply put a copy of the silk icon set into their repository, wasting space. Using the silk icons as git submodule is more elegant and keeps your main repository pollution-free. As a bonus, you can fork and commit your own icons - and eventually merge them back.
